# What's for dinner?

## Overview
[Whatâ€™s for dinner?](https://stefcruz.github.io/ci_milestone2/) is a website that provides recipe ideas and nutritional information. It brings a vast number of recipe ideas based on a keyword entered in the search bar, and also has a section dedicated to inspire the user with preselected recipe ideas. Finally, it allows the user to search for the nutritional information of many different foods by entering the ingredients list in the text box.

The recipes and the nutritional analysis are made available from the [Edamam](https://www.edamam.com/) API.

## Features

### Existing Features

#### Navigation bar
The navbar contains links to the different sections of the site and collapses when the user accesses the website through mobile.

Nav desktop and tablet:

![Nav desktop and tablet](https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/features/nav-desktop-tablet.png)

Nav mobile:

![Nav desktop and mobile](https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/features/nav-mobile.png)

Also, the site also presents the favicon with the logo.

![Favicon](https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/features/favicon.png)

#### Main section
The search box allows the user to perform a search, which can be based off an ingredient or name of the dish. If one or more checkboxes are ticked, the inner text of the ticked checkbox is passed as a parameter to the API URL and this will filter the search result. 

![Main section](https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/features/main-section.png)

The tooltip over the checkboxes works on desktop only. There is no equivalent for mobile as the page would be too wordy.

<img src="https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/features/main-section-hover.png" width="600">

The checkboxes are stacked on mobile to make it easier for the user to select the options.

![Search box on mobile](https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/features/search-box-mobile.png)

##### Back to top arrow
The arrow comes up after scroll down and was implemented to bring the user back to top.

![Back to top arrow](https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/features/arrow-up.png)

##### Recipe cards
The recipe cards contain an image, recipe title, number of ingredients so the user can judge the level of difficulty and preparation time of the recipe, health labels in case of any allergy and a link to the original recipe for full list of ingredients and instructions. The data comes from the API [Edamam](https://www.edamam.com/).

![Recipe cards](https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/features/recipe-card.png)

##### Error handling main section
If the API call fails, the error message below is displayed.

![Error handling](https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/features/main-section-error-handling.png)

#### Inspiration section
The idea of this section is to bring recipe ideas for the user based on preset filters. 

![Inspiration section](https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/features/inspiration-section.png)

Due to the pandemic, the first suggestions are recipes to boost the immune system, followed by well-balanced recipes and vegetarian options. Again the data comes from the API [Edamam](https://www.edamam.com/) and the user can use the arrows right or left to see all the options.

![Recipe ideas Immunity](https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/features/inspiration-section-recipe-cards.png)

##### Error handling inspiration section
If the API call fails, the error message below is displayed.

![Error handling](https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/features/inspiration-section-error-handling.png)

#### Nutritional information section
This section provides the user the ability to search for the nutritional value of a recipe by entering the unit, measure and the ingredient in the text area. For example: 1 cup of rice, 10 oz of chickpeas.

<img src="https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/features/nutritional-info-section.png" width="600">

The API brings back the nutritional value per ingredient. For the example above, the calorie and weight of the first ingredient 1 cup of rice and separately the calorie and weight for the 10 oz of chickpeas.

<img src="https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/features/nutritional-info-table-ingredient.png" width="600">

In addition, it also returns the nutritional value for the dish with the detailed number of calories and all the other nutrients present in the dish.

<img src="https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/features/nutritional-info-table-values.png" width="600">

Note the search result by ingredient and for the dish is hidden until API is called, i.e. until user performs a search.

##### Error handling nutritional value
If the API call fails, the error message below is displayed.

![Error handling](https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/features/nutritional-info-error-handling.png)

#### Contact page
The contact page has the same heading and style as the home page.

<img src="https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/features/contact-page.png" width="600">

The contact form contains an opt in option for newsletter and the potential topics the user is interested in.

![Contact form](https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/features/contact-form.png)

It also has mandatory fields and provides the user feedback for when these fields are empty. The feedback is not only given in the field but underneath the submit button.

![Negative feedback](https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/features/contact-form-feedback-negative.png)

Likewise, the feedback is positive when the fields are filled in and the message underneath reinforces the positive message.

![Positive feedback](https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/features/contact-form-feedback-positive.png)

The Bootstrap form validation was used in conjunction with the [Email JS](https://www.emailjs.com/) tool to create this feature.

#### Footer
The footer has links to the sections of the homepage and also social media.

Footer mobile:

<img src="https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/features/footer-mobile.png" width="200">

Footer desktop and tablet:

![Footer desktop and tablet](https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/features/footer-desktop.png)

#### 404 Page
The personalised 404 page was created in case the site does not load.

<img src="https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/features/404-page.png" width="600">

### Features Left to Implement

The possibilities are limitless when it comes to implement new features on a webapp. What I would like to have done is:

- Vegetarian/Vegan website  
The initial idea was to create a website with vegetarian/vegan recipes only. However, the API imposed a few limitations and this goal could not be attained. A simple test was done with the search term "pork" applying the filters vegetarian/vegan, the result still came back where pork is classified as vegetarian. I could not establish whether this is an API error thus decided to change the focus.

- Swiper.js infinite loop  
Could not make the swiper infinite loop work when the data comes from the API. The swiper achieves the "infinite" effect by duplicating 3 or 4 slides in the HTML. When the data comes from the API, the swiper duplicates the slide however there is no data in it, which results in slides being shown empty in the carousel.  [Demo of what was planned to be implemented](https://swiperjs.com/demos/200-infinite-loop.html).

The features that would be nice to have are:
- Sorting and filtering options for the search results
- Button to "see more" recipes, not only the first 8 presented
- Registration/Profile page where the user can create a wish list and post recipes

## Technologies
This project was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. An extra effort has been made to use pure Vanilla JavaScript rather than jQuery, with the intention of learning the foundation of the language and becoming more familiar with JavaScript concepts.

In terms of styling, this website utilised the framework Bootstrap to support through the implementation of a mobile first approach and the preprocessor SASS. Due to the size of the project, the SASS files were divided into partials according to the sections of the website which makes the directory tidier and easier to locate specific files. 

![SASS partials](https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/sass-partials.png)

Another point to notice is that SASS enables nesting media queries within the block of CSS beside the properties being changed, which again helps the organisation and maintenance of the style sheets. Idea taken from [this blog post](https://css-tricks.com/conditional-media-query-mixins/).

## Testing

### W3C HTML Validator

Both index.html and contact.html presented a few errors/warnings that were fixed and finally passed the W3C HTML validation. 

![HTML Validator](https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/w3c-html-validator.png)


### W3C CSS Validator

The CSS also returned no errors.

![CSS Validator](https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/w3c-css-validator.png)


### Google Lighthouse

All the scores on Google Lighthouse were high except performance. This section suffered due to the external links at the <head> of the HTML, which references the Bootstrap, Swiper and Font Awesome style sheets. These style sheets could not be removed as they are essential for the project, thus score could not be improved. Also,  I added `rel="noopener"` on the external links to improve the score on best practices. Explanation of what it does [here](https://dev.to/gulshansaini/what-is-rel-noopener-1214).

<img src="https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/testing/chrome-huawei-bug.jpg" width="300">

##### General bugs

###### Nav

- Navbar not collapsing after click when href is an anchor link, it only works when links to another page. Solved by adding `data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".navbar-collapse"` to the <a> tags. [Solution here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42401606/how-to-hide-collapsible-bootstrap-4-navbar-on-click).

###### Main section

- Icon of ticked checkbox looked to thin for Android. Solution: return to the default icon.

<img src="https://github.com/stefcruz/ci_milestone2/blob/master/readme/testing/mobile-ticked-checkbox.jpg" width="250">

- Clicking area of the clear icon on search bar too narrow. Solution: increased it following [this tutorial](https://ishadeed.com/article/clickable-area/).
- Font too small in recipe cards. Solution: Increased font size to 1rem (16px).
- The API will throw an error if there are no results for the combination of the dish or ingredient + diet label. For example, search for lasagna ticking the checkbox "low-fat". Understandably, there does not exist a low-fat lasagna. Possible solution: add an if statement considering the scenario where if the ingredient typed + diet label combination is null, then show a helpful error message. However it was not implemented due to time constraints.

###### Nutritional value

- Removed event listener to perform search pressing enter. This was required as the text area requires pressing enter to skip line to enter the ingredients, not to call the API.

###### Contact page

- Checkboxes and radio buttons were too close to one another on mobile. Solution: add margin bottom to all input boxes.
